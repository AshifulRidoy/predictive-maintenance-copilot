TURBOFAN ENGINE MAINTENANCE GUIDE

1. VIBRATION MONITORING
- Normal vibration levels: < 0.5 in/sec
- High vibration (>0.7 in/sec) indicates:
  * Unbalanced rotor
  * Bearing degradation
  * Fan blade damage
- Corrective actions:
  * Inspect fan blades for FOD (Foreign Object Damage)
  * Check bearing clearances
  * Perform rotor balancing if needed

2. TEMPERATURE MONITORING
- Normal operating temperature (T30): 1580°F ± 20°F
- High temperature (>1620°F) causes:
  * Accelerated component wear
  * Reduced component life
  * Potential thermal distortion
- Required actions for high T30:
  * Reduce power setting
  * Inspect combustor for damage
  * Check fuel nozzle spray pattern
  * Verify bleed valve operation

3. PRESSURE RATIO (EPR) DEGRADATION
- Normal EPR: 1.30 ± 0.05
- Declining EPR indicates:
  * Compressor fouling
  * Turbine blade erosion
  * Internal leakage
- Maintenance procedures:
  * Perform compressor water wash
  * Borescope inspection of turbine
  * Check clearances at turbine seals

4. BLEED AIR SYSTEM
- Bleed enthalpy normal range: 390 ± 10 BTU/lb
- High bleed values suggest:
  * Bleed valve malfunction
  * Excessive secondary air flow
- Corrective maintenance:
  * Inspect bleed valve actuator
  * Check valve seat for wear
  * Verify control system operation

5. FUEL SYSTEM
- Normal fuel-air ratio (farB): 0.030 ± 0.002
- Rich mixture (>0.033) causes:
  * Incomplete combustion
  * Carbon buildup
  * High EGT
- Lean mixture (<0.027) causes:
  * Combustion instability
  * Potential flameout
- Maintenance actions:
  * Clean fuel nozzles
  * Check fuel pump output
  * Verify fuel control unit calibration

6. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
- Daily: Visual inspection, vibration check
- Weekly: Oil analysis, filter inspection
- Monthly: Borescope inspection
- Quarterly: Bearing inspection
- Annual: Major overhaul assessment
