ENGINE TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES

SYMPTOM: High Vibration Levels

Step 1: Immediate Actions
- Reduce power to idle
- Monitor vibration trend
- If vibration >1.0 in/sec, shut down engine

Step 2: Visual Inspection
- Inspect fan blades for damage
- Check for loose components
- Look for oil leaks near bearings

Step 3: Diagnostic Tests
- Perform vibration spectrum analysis
- Check bearing temperatures
- Measure shaft runout

Step 4: Corrective Measures
- Replace damaged fan blades
- Rebalance rotor assembly
- Replace worn bearings
- Realign engine mounts

SYMPTOM: Increasing Exhaust Temperature

Step 1: Immediate Actions
- Reduce power by 10%
- Monitor temperature trend
- Check for engine fire indications

Step 2: System Checks
- Verify thermocouple accuracy
- Check fuel flow rate
- Inspect combustor section

Step 3: Root Cause Analysis
- Deteriorated turbine blades
- Combustor damage
- Fuel nozzle blockage
- Cooling air bypass

Step 4: Repair Actions
- Replace damaged turbine blades
- Repair/replace combustor cans
- Clean or replace fuel nozzles
- Seal air leaks in cooling passages

SYMPTOM: Low Engine Pressure Ratio

Step 1: Performance Analysis
- Compare current EPR to baseline
- Check compressor efficiency
- Measure turbine gas temperature

Step 2: Compressor Assessment
- Perform compressor wash
- Inspect for erosion damage
- Check variable vane rigging

Step 3: Turbine Inspection
- Borescope turbine blades
- Measure blade dimensions
- Check for thermal distortion

Step 4: Restoration
- Replace eroded compressor blades
- Restore turbine blade profiles
- Adjust variable geometry
- Seal internal leakage paths
